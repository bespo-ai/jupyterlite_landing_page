# It’s About Discovery

We are data scientists, at heart and by trade, so when computers started talking convincingly, our brains began obessesing over what this means for our craft. Developers got amazing AI tools recently, from assistants that speed up code writing, to “AI software engineers” that can (supposedly) complete tasks autonomously.

And while these tools are also helpful for data scientist, they don’t address the core of what data science **is**.
Data science is not about writing code (although necessary), and it’s not about moving tickets from “backlog” to “done”.
Data science is research, and research is about discovery and communication.

Research starts with not knowing. You have to poke your fingers at some holes and see what comes out the other side. And it doesn't end in a PR. It ends with communicating your discoveries to drive impact.

For AI to help data scientists, it must support discovery and communication.
These are the workflows we think are important. These are the workflows we are passionate to build for. 

# Enter the Notebook

While the critics are still split on notebooks' place in the engineering stack, it is undoubtedly built for the things we think are important. Notebooks are defined by a direct touch and rich outputs that help experimention and make discovery. A notebook is also a timeline, and a story. to communicate findings.

All of this, together with the fact that notebooks did not get the same AI love that other tools have, meant we had to start there. With the tool we love so dearly.

Appropriately to researchers, we aim to discover the best ways to use this technology for ourselves and our fellow researchers, to make this creative act the best it can be.

# Principles

Here are some principles we discovered, that we use to guide us. At least for now:

### Focus on acts that break flow

Code errors, dependencies issues, and "parsing hell" of that annoying JSON column. Vincent should help with all of that.

### Creativity > Productivity

It’s not about smashing tickets, it’s about supporting deep thinking and understanding, to do our best work.

### Agentic workspace

We want more than autocomplete, but not to outsource entire projects. We call it an "Agentic Workspace" (cheesy, but conveys the spirit). A magical canvas that removes the toil and complement the core to help *you* be at the top of you game.

### Lean on the power of the notebook

Jupyter notebooks are extremely powerful, and a native environment for an AI agent to accomplish things. Vincent can learn about a library, search the web, and edit .py files, all within the notebook itself. This also allows everyone to customize and extend Vincent’s capabilities. We will have more to say about this design philosophy in the future.
